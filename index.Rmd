# Welcome! I am Revath.

##### I am a senior biomedical engineering major at UT Austin.

##### I enjoy football and rock climbing and video games. 

##### I am interested in learning more about data science and one dat becoming a data scientist.  

##### I don't have any data-related projects either, but if I did you could find them [here](/portfolio)!
